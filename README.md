This repository holds all files needed for an application that is meant to aid in room planning, aimed at people with small living spaces such as college students.

Functionality:  
-Creating Rooms with a name and dimensions  
-Adding 'things' to rooms with a name, dimensions, and a position.  

Planned:  
-Generate a simple floorplan view of the room with objects inside.  

Dependency:  
Ruby on Rails (If you need to install, I recommend http://installrails.com).

Notes:  
Currently this app is failry useless because I have not been able to generate floorplans, due to a lack of standalone gems for the purpose.
